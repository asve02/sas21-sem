# sas21-sem Analysis

This repository contains the Quarto .qmd file, data, and generated figures related to analysis of scanning electron microscopy (SEM) data.
The samples were collected during the Synoptic Arctic Survey-2021. The collected seawater samples were first 1.2µm filtered to select prokaryotic fraction.
The samples were collected from 5 different stations at four different depths: Epipelagic (10m, Chla-max) and Mesopelagic (Temp-max and 500m depth).
In the analysis, the samples were analysed using SEM and SEM-EDX to analyse cell shape, morphological features and elemental composition in both epipelagic and mesopelagic depth layers.
This provides the first electron microscopic analysis of natural prokaryotic communities from the Central Arctic Ocean (CAO).
